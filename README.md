# loop-statement

This is my first repository on Git hub but definitely not the last. Many more will come.

This file is about a looping statment with following conditions to be followed:

If n is odd, print Weird:

If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird

If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird

If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird
